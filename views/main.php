            <p class = "news-text">Israel says its troops killed militants in direct clashes with Hamas in the northern part of the Gaza Strip on Sunday (David Harding writes).
            The Hamas fighters were killed as they left a tunnel close to the Erez crossing, the Israel Defence Forces claimed, in some of the first direct fighting between Israeli and Hamas troops since the start of the war on October 7.
            Several more Palestinians were killed in other nearby battles, the IDF added, although it was not confirmed how many militants were killed. </p>
